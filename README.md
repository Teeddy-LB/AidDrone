**Aid Drone Project**
This is a prototype drone that could carry up to 70lbs of payloads, along with a generator to keep it powered over very long distances.

This is inspired by areas of conflict in the world where supply lines are cut, and aid is unable to be delivered by conventional means.

The general design currently consist of an aluminum tube frame chassis surrounding a generator, electronics, and battery.
